   <h3>Software Testing Lifecycle (STLC)</h3>
   <p>It is a set of process executed in a sequence, systematic and planned  manner in-order to achieve the quality and testing goal. Each activity is carried out in a Planned and sytematic manner way with each phase have a different goals and results</p>
   <h3>Stages of Software Testing Life Cycle</h3>
   <li>Requirement Analysis</li>
   <li>Test Planning </li>
   <li>Test Design </li> 
   <li>Test Environment Setup </li> 
   <li>Test Execution</li>
   <li>Bug  Reporting and Management</li> 
   <li>Requirement traceability matrix</li>  
   <li>Test Closure</li>
   
   <h3>Requiremnt Analysis</h3>
      <p>Analyze the business requirement and plan all the testing activities to be done to deliver a quality 
    Test strategy,analyze the risks (tools,resource and time )Schedule and time line deliverable </p>
   
   <h3>Test Planning</h3>
        <p>Test planning is the first step in testing process which is based on the Requirement analysis The test plan varry according to the 
     company and product but there is an IEEE Standard for test plan </p>
    <li>Test plan Identifier - A unique plane name </li>
    <li>Introduction - Overview and objectives of test plan</li>
    <li>References - Project plan related documents</li>
    <li>Test items - Product or Software with detailed Specification</li>
    <li>Features to be Tested</li>
    <li>Features not to be Tested</li>
    <li>Approach</li>
    <li>Testcase status - Pass,Fail,skip..</li>
    <li>Test Deliverables</li>
  
    <h3>Test Design </h3>
        <p>The test case design should cover all the aspects <b>Specifications</b> such as boundary value analysis,equivalence partioning, decision table,state transition and usecase testing <b>Structure based</b> such as statement testing(covers each lines of code like unit testing),<b>Decission testing</b>( It covers all the branch of codes),Condition testing <b>Experience based </b> such as guessing the error and explotary testing</p>
   <h3>Test Environment Setup</h3>
     <p> The Environment setups such as System,database,network,Operating system, and Other Components with licsnse according to the requirement of the project</p>
   <h3>Test execution </h3>
    <p> The test execution is the process of execution of the Program or software or and check wether the Expected and Actual results are same</p>
   <h3>Bug  Reporting and Management</h3> 
    <p> During the testing process many bugs may come then the tester will take the screenshot or Video logs of the Application or software under Test and Detailed specification of the environment setup and riase an issue in Bug Reporting tool. Once the developer solves the issue then the tester retest again the application or software under test and update the test status</p>
   <h3>Requirement traceability matrix</h3>  
    <p>Requirement traceability matrix is mostly in the form of table which contains the details of  each phase of testing met the requirement of the project </p>
   <h3>Test Closure</h3>
    <p> The Test Closure is a phase which contains no of cases tested </p>
